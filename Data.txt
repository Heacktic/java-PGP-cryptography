Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems
that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding
private key. Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical
problems termed one-way functions. Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the
private key secret; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.



Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy
and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and
decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the
security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.[3]
PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP, an open standard of PGP encryption software,
standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.



The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael
(Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]), is a specification for the encryption of electronic data
established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
AES is a variant of the Rijndael block cipher developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan
Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, who submitted a proposal to NIST during the AES selection process.
Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes. For AES, NIST selected three
members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different
key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
